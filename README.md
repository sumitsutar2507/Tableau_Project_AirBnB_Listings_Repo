# 🏡 AirBnB Listings Data Visualization (Tableau Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing AirBnB listings data using Tableau to uncover pricing trends, revenue patterns and geographical insights.  
An interactive dashboard was built to help understand key factors influencing pricing and profitability.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
AirBnB hosts and stakeholders lack clear insights into:
- Pricing variations across locations  
- Revenue trends over time  
- Impact of property features (like bedrooms)  

This makes it difficult to optimize pricing and maximize revenue.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To analyze AirBnB listings data and build an interactive dashboard that helps in understanding pricing, demand and revenue patterns.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes multiple tables:

### 🗂 Listings
- id  
- listing_id  
- zipcode  
- bedrooms  
- price  
- latitude  
- longitude
- etc... 

### 🗂 Calendar
- listing_id  
- date  
- price
- etc...

### 🗂 Reviews
- listing_id  
- review_date
- etc...
